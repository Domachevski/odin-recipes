        <li>1 cup cold water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Toppings:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ounces low moisture mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup no salt added canned crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>6 leaves fresh basil, torn</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast over the top.<p>Stand for 5 minutes.<p>Stir in cold water and salt.<p>Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.</li>
        <p> </p>
        <li>Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <p> </p>
        <li>Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls.<p>Coat with olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours.<p>Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise.</li>
        <p> </p>
        <li>Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using.</li>
        <p> </p>
        <li>Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C).<p>Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.</li>
        <p> </p>
        <li>Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and stretch gradually until about 14 inches in diameter, or about the size of the pizza stone.<p>Place on the floured peel.</li>            <li>Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon pepper over the top.<p>Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some empty areas, <p>then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over top.</li>
        <p> </p>
        <li>With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure dough will release from the peel easily. <p>Place the tip of the peel at the back of the preheated pizza stone, and remove the peel so that the pizza is left on the stone.</li>
        <p> </p>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <p> </p>
        <li>Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off the peel onto a work surface. <p>Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves randomly over the pizza. <p>Cut into wedges and serve.</li>
        <p> </p>
        <li>Follow Steps 5 through 9 to make the second pizza.</li>
    </ol>
